# Ouaizeur
Fun weather website

This website is open-source and probably needs more functionnality. Here is the link : https://ouaizeur.herokuapp.com/

I'm fetching the forecast data with https://www.weatherapi.com/, I've the free version so please don't spam requests, because my API keys is limited in requests/day.

To use the dependency, use "npm install", and to start the server, use "npm run start".
To modifiy the scss, use ".\dart-sass\sass.bat .\public\css\style.scss .\public\css\style.css --watch".

This "main" branch is for the development, the only difference it has with the "deploy-version" branch is that the node_modules file isn't installed.

Well, that's all I have to say, enjoy !
